    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>Beginnings</h2>
    <p>After the great Croatian liberation war (1683-1699), when the immediate danger from the Turks had passed, the reorganization of the lička, otočka, ogulin and Slunj Generalates (1699) took place. Vukmanić, which became the administrative-political center of the whole region in <strong>1704</strong>, also included the areas from Korana towards Strinčić, Knez Gorica, and Skakavac, from Ribari to Selnice, where the 9th Vukmanić military unit was stationed.</p>
    <p>From Ravna Gora, Brod na Kupi, Delnice, and Čabar on July 29, <strong>1703</strong>, General Count Karlo Auerperger allocated these lands to increase the defense and placed soldiers and settlers named (Abramović, Colnar, Kvaternik, Jakovac, Gregurić, Kosa, Tkalčić, Muhvić (today Muić), Kalčić, Belobrajdić, Šepac, Štefanić, Paur, Mihelčić, Kristanić, Špoljarić etc.)</p>
    <p>After the first resettlement, the principle of Hanibal Porcia in <strong>1705</strong> began a second resettlement of abandoned lands in the areas of today's Skakavac, with the population from Delnica and Ravna Gora, and the resettlement was completed in <strong>1714</strong> when residents from the surroundings of Gerovo, Brod na Kupi, and Moravica (Vukelić, Vučić, Jurković, Holjević, Crnković, Mulc, Lisac, Štimac, Johković, Špoljarić, Pintar) settled in Vukmanić and Knez Gorica, where they began to cultivate and clear the lands, establishing a more stable and defended community.</p>
    <h2>Interesting facts throughout the years</h2>
    <p>The first potatoes were planted on Vukmanić in <strong>1768</strong>. Potatoes were brought from the Czech Republic and Silesia. It was brought by the people of Vukmanić, who found themselves in the Czech Republic and Silesia as soldiers.</p>
    <p>A year after that, in <strong>1769</strong>, the first corn was planted in Vukmanić.</p>
    <p>In the years <strong>1811</strong> and <strong>1812</strong> the wine was so incredibly good that they made more wine than they could store.</p>
    <p>In the year <strong>1876</strong> the region was plagued by smallpox.</p>
    <p>Ten years after the smallpox there is a cholera epidemic in the year <strong>1886</strong>.</p>
    <p>In <strong>1888</strong>, the first people from Vukmanić leave for work in America. Ivan Obranović and Janko Derkos were the first to leave. Only two years later, they send financial help for the local church.</p>
    <p>By <strong>1899</strong> more than 50 people from Vukmanić moved to the US.</p>
    <p>The Karlovac-Sisak railway was put into operation in the year <strong>1903</strong>. It was supposed to go along the Trebinja River towards Utinja. Some residents of Vukmanić and Knezgorica did not want to give up their land, so the railway went in a different direction.</p>
    <p>In <strong>1904</strong>, there was no rain in the region for two months, so the people were left "without bread, and the cattle without fodder".</p>
    <p>From <strong>1914</strong> to <strong>1918</strong>, the First World War lasted. Quite a few people from the Region died on various battlefields throughout Europe.</p>
    <p>From <strong>1941</strong> to <strong>1945</strong>, the Second World War was going on.</p>
    <p>After the war, the communist authorities intended to displace Vukmanić. Dr. Ivan Ribar stopped those intentions.</p>
    <p>Vukmanić got access to electricity in <strong>1951</strong>.</p>
    <p>A year after in <strong>1952</strong> Vukmanić becomes a municipality.</p>
    <p>More than a hundred men and women from Vukmanić and the surrounding villages are going to work in Germany in <strong>1969</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>1974</strong> In December, water pipes are installed. Next year every house has water.</p>
    <p>The village and the region was hit hard by the Croatian war of independence (<strong>1991</strong>-<strong>1995</strong>). Many people from the village lost their lives and many more fled to nearby Karlovac. Many left but not all returned. After the war, the population was decreased significantly.</p>
